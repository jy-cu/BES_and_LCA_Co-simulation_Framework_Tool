# BES_and_LCA_Co-simulation_Framework_Tool

This repository results from research conducted through my PhD thesis at Cardiff University. 

The thesis is titled 'Enabling Net-Zero Buildings through Automated Compliance Checking, Driven by Energy and Life Cycle Assessment Co-Simulation'.

The BES and LCA co-simulation proposed in this research is underpinned by two software tools, which are in this repository, these are:

IFC_to_gbxml.py - this tool translates ifc 4x3 files to gbxml and is based on the converter developed by MGVISSCHERS https://github.com/MGVisschers/IFC-to-gbXML-converter.

material_takeoff.ts - this tool extracts material quantities from .ifc files.
